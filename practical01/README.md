This program helps us understand the basics of c starting from the printf, where we print integer and float values. And integrate those values in the sentence.

* ./scan

Please input two positive integers
4 
6
 You entered 4 and 6
 num1 is even and num2 is even

In this program we learn the use of scanf fuction. which is used to take input from the user and that input can be used further in the code.
As shown in the above output the program takes 2 input which should be positive and tells if it is even or odd.
