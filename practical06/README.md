# Practical06

This is the 6th practical where we code and execute matrix multiplication of two different sizes using loops. We also create two files one main and other matmult. The matmult file contents the matrix multiplication fucntion which we return C to the main file. 

## Compile:

## 1. matmult function:

```bash
gcc -o scan use_scanf.c

```
# Execute:

```bash
./scan

Enter an int and a double:
2
3.5678
You entered: 2 and 3.567800
```
